/*
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one 
share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.


// Example 1)
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

// Example 2)
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
*/

// DP Solution
const maxProfit = prices => {
  let min = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
  let max = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    min = Math.min(min, prices[i]); // caches the smallest value in the array;
    max = Math.max(max, prices[i] - min); // tries to find the highest difference between the smallest value in the array and the current indice's number
  }
  return max;
};

// Runtime Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(1)

console.log(maxProfit([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]));
